# 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Crop Recommendation Dataset containing agricultural parameters such as:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH Value
- Rainfall

Target:

- Recommended Crop

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project compares multiple Machine Learning algorithms.

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

The model with the highest accuracy is automatically selected and saved.

Additionally,

- StandardScaler is used for feature normalization.
- K-Means clustering is performed for analysis.

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opticrop.git

cd opticrop
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional)

Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Train the Model (Only if models are not available)

```bash
python train.py
```

This generates:

```
models/crop_model.joblib

models/scaler.joblib
```

---

## 5. Run the Flask Application

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 6. Open in Browser

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

# 🌾 How to Find the Best Crop

1. Open the application.
2. Navigate to **Find Your Crop**.
3. Enter the following values:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Soil pH
- Rainfall (mm)

4. Click **Predict Crop**.
5. The Machine Learning model analyzes the input.
6. The recommended crop is displayed instantly.

---

# 🌾 Input Parameters & Valid Ranges

To obtain accurate crop recommendations, enter values within the expected agricultural ranges shown below.

| Parameter | Description | Valid Range | Unit |
|-----------|-------------|------------:|------|
| Nitrogen (N) | Nitrogen content in soil | 0 – 140 | kg/ha |
| Phosphorus (P) | Phosphorus content in soil | 5 – 145 | kg/ha |
| Potassium (K) | Potassium content in soil | 5 – 205 | kg/ha |
| Temperature | Average temperature | 8 – 44 | °C |
| Humidity | Relative humidity | 14 – 100 | % |
| Soil pH | Soil acidity/alkalinity | 3.5 – 10.0 | pH |
| Rainfall | Annual rainfall | 20 – 300 | mm |

> **Note:** These ranges are based on the dataset used to train the machine learning model. Entering values outside these ranges may reduce prediction accuracy.

---

# 🌾 How to Find the Best Crop

1. Launch the application.
2. Navigate to **Find Your Crop** from the homepage.
3. Fill in all seven input fields:

   - Nitrogen (N)
   - Phosphorus (P)
   - Potassium (K)
   - Temperature (°C)
   - Humidity (%)
   - Soil pH
   - Rainfall (mm)

4. Ensure each value falls within the valid ranges listed above.
5. Click the **Predict Crop** button.
6. The machine learning model processes the inputs.
7. The system displays the most suitable crop for cultivation.
